# Dealytics

**Dealytics** is Bangladeshâ€™s first marketplace aggregator powered by analytics. We help buyers find the best deals on products and services by tracking prices and predicting discounts across both online and offline markets. Sellers gain data-driven insights to manage demand, optimize stock, and minimize intermediaries. With built-in negotiation tools and a reputation system, we ensure fair pricing and informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers.

For a detailed introduction to the project, check out our [Project Overview](/ProjectIntro.pdf).

## Project Outline
This project was developed as part of the **CSE-326 (Information System Design Sessional)** course at **BUET CSE**. You can find more details about the course [here](/Jan_2024_CSE_326_Course_Outline.pdf). 

This repository contains **design artifacts** related to the application. It does not include actual code implementation or deployment-specific work. The project was a collaborative effort by a team of six members.

The course covered six key design aspects, each presented in the following order:

### **Presentation Topics & Presenters**

| **Presentation Topic**                              | **Presenter**                          |
